This project aims to create an e-commerce application for purchasing coffee beans, built using the MERN stack. It consists of three repositories:

Front end - for general consumers
Front end admin - for managing store products and monitoring orders
Back end - for storing and retrieving data

**Front End**

The homepage includes sections for Home, Shop, and Contact Us. New users need to sign up, while existing users can sign in. Products can be filtered by selecting 'blended' or 'single origin'. Once signed in, items added to the cart are saved, and the user can access the same cart even after refreshing the page. Stripe is used as the payment platform.

**Front End Admin**

The admin front end allows the webpage owner to add and remove items as needed. The order page is used to track orders and update the delivery status of packages.

**Back End**
The backend uses MongoDB as the database.
